## Who am I?

- Bruno Rodrigues, head of the statistics and data strategy departments at the
 Ministry of Research and Higher education in Luxembourg

- Using R since 2009

- Slides available online at [https://is.gd/nix_dipf](https://is.gd/nix_dipf)

- Code available at: [https://github.com/b-rodrigues/dipf_workshop](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/dipf_workshop)

## Goal of this workshop

- Learn just enough of Nix to use it for your R projects
- Skim how to use Nix with Github Actions
- Time allowing: how to make your own binary cache using [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)

## What is Nix? (1/2)

- A package manager
- A programming language
- An operating system ([NixOS](https://nixos.org/))

Our focus today: the package manager

## What is Nix? (2/2)

A word of warning: Nix is quite complex

It does require some time to learn on the user's part

But `{rix}` will help

## The Nix package manager

Package manager: tool to install and manage *packages*

Package: any piece of software (not just R packages)

A popular package manager:

## The reproducibility continuum

- Make sure that the required/correct version of R (or any other language) is
  installed;

- Make sure that the required versions of packages are installed;

- Make sure that system dependencies are installed (for example,
  Java installation for rJava);

- Make sure that you can install all of this for the hardware you have on hand.

## Reproducibility in the R ecosystem

- Per-project environments not often used
- Popular choice: `{renv}`, but deals with R packages only
- Still need to take care of R itself
- System-level dependencies as well!

A popular approach: Docker + `{renv}` (see [Rocker project](https://rocker-project.org/))

Nix deals with everything, with one single text file (called a Nix expression)!

## "Functional" package manager (1/2)

- Nix: a *functional* package mananger

- Functional, as in, inpired by mathematical functions

- Why math functions?

-> f(x)=y

## "Functional" package manager (2/2)

- Building a Nix expression always results in the same output

- Output doesn't depend on state of current system:

> The idea is to always deploy component closures: if we deploy a component,
> then we must also deploy its dependencies, their dependencies, and so on. That
> is, we must always deploy a set of components that is closed under the
> ''depends on'' relation. Since closures are selfcontained, they are the units
> of complete software deployment. After all, if a set of components is not
> closed, it is not safe to deploy, since using them might cause other
> components to be referenced that are missing on the target system.

## A basic Nix expression (1/6)

```
let
  pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845.tar.gz") {};
  system_packages = builtins.attrValues {
    inherit (pkgs) R ;
  };
in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [ system_packages ];
    shellHook = "R --vanilla";
  }
```

There's a lot to discuss here!

## A basic Nix expression (2/6)

- Written in the Nix language (not discussed)
- Defines the repository to use (with a fixed revision)
- Lists packages to install
- Defines the output: a development shell

## A basic Nix expression (3/6)

- Software for Nix is defined as a mono-repository of tens of thousands of expressions on Github
- Github: we can use any commit to pin package versions for reproducibility!
- For example, the following commit installs R 4.3.1 and associated packages:

```
pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/976fa3369d722e76f37c77493d99829540d43845.tar.gz") {};
```

- Let's take a look at the [repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)...

## A basic Nix expression (4/6)

- `system_packages`: a variable that lists software to install
- In this case, only R:

```
system_packages = builtins.attrValues {
  inherit (pkgs) R ;
};
```

## A basic Nix expression (5/6)

- Finally, we define a shell:

```
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ system_packages ];
  shellHook = "R --vanilla";
}
```

- This shell will come with the software defined in `system_packages` (`buildInputs`)
- And launch `R --vanilla` when started (`shellHook`)

## A basic Nix expression (6/6)

- Writing these expressions requires learning a new language
- While incredibly powerful, if all we want are per-project reproducible dev shells...
- ...then `{rix}` will help!

## Nix expressions

- Nix expressions can be used to install software
- But we will use them to build per-project development shells
- We will include R, LaTeX packages, or Quarto, Python, Julia....
- Nix takes care of installing every dependency down to the compiler!

## CRAN and Bioconductor

- CRAN is the repository of R packages to extend the language
- As of writing, +20000 packages available
- Biocondcutor: repository with a focus on Bioinformatics: +2000 more packages
- Almost all available through `nixpkgs` in the `rPackages` set!
- Find packages [here](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.11&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=dplyr)

## rix: reproducible development environments with Nix (1/2)

- `{rix}` ([website](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/index.html)) makes writing Nix expression easy!
- Simply use the provided `rix()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

rix(r_ver = "4.3.1",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "ggplot2"),
    system_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = NULL,
    tex_pkgs = NULL,
    ide = "rstudio",
    # This shellHook is required to run Rstudio on Linux
    # you can ignore it on other systems
    shell_hook = "export QT_XCB_GL_INTEGRATION=none",
    project_path = ".")
```

- List required R version and packages
- Optionally: more system packages, packages hosted on Github, or LaTeX packages
- Optionally: an IDE (Rstudio, Radian, VS Code or "other")
- Work interactively in an isolated environment!

## rix: reproducible development environments with Nix (2/2)

- Doesn't need Nix to be installed to generate expressions
- (But Nix is needed to build expressions)
- Many vignettes to get you started! [See here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rix/articles/)


## Non-interactive use

- `{rix}` makes it easy to run pipelines in the right environment
- (Little sidenote: the best tool to build pipelines in R is `{targets}`)
- See `expressions/nix_targets_pipeline`
- Can also run the pipeline like so:

```
cd /absolute/path/to/pipeline/ && nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

## Nix and Github Actions: running pipelines

- Possible to easily run a `{targets}` pipeline on Github actions
- Simply run `rix::tar_nix_ga()` to generate the required files
- Commit and push, and watch the actions run!
- See [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_targets_pipeline/tree/master).

## Nix and Github Actions: writing papers

- Easy collaboration on papers as well
- See [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix_paper/tree/master)
- Just focus on writing!

## Subshells

- Also possible to evaluate single functions inside a "subshell"
- Works from R installed via Nix or not!
- Very useful to use hard-to-install packages such as {arrow}
- See `expressions/subshell`
